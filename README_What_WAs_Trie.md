##Current problem
1. Onboot the sys (can be bypassed) the kiosk mode
2. requires constant privi
3. long home press exit the kiosk (huge problem) // since it different for multiple systems
4. once off sys setup

##approaches tried
1. launcher app (set it as a default home activity)
2. pinning onBoot (problem) require permissions to access the kiosk mode constantly
3. 



the guys who created free "Toddler lock" apk somehow managed to did it - download and see for yourself :)

when you run it, it asks for permission to run as home app and you need to check the box "use as default". To exit from app, 
you need to press on all 4 corners of the screen. All the buttons but power one are locked. So there is a way for sure to do that!
